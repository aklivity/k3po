:+1::tada: First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to K3PO! :tada::+1:

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/aklivity/k3po/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/aklivity/k3po/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and ideally an **executable test case** demonstrating that the expected behavior is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Execute `./mvnw clean install` locally to verify a successful build and confirm that the GitHub Actions automated PR build completes successfully.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Slack Community #k3po channel][community-join] and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the K3PO source code in the [Slack Community #k3po channel][community-join].


Thank you for helping to make the K3PO open source project successful! ðŸ™‚
